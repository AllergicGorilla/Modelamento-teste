## Epidemic modeling
In this toy model, we simulate an epidemic.

The project is hosted at [heroku](https://modelamento-teste.herokuapp.com/).

#### If you want to host the app on your own machine:
Run on your terminal:
```bash
$ node index.js
```
Then go to http://localhost:3000 on your web browser and tada!:fireworks: it's your own web app, served on your own machine.
